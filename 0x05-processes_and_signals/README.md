A process is an executing instance of a program. Each process is guaranteed a unique PID, which is always a non-negative integer.
A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Is just like an interrupt. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.
This Directory focuses on processes and signals.
